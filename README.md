# bgk2d

Two-dimensional BGK mode

Here are the files for the code and outputs for the results published in Ng, C. S., Kinetic Flux Ropes: Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes for the Vlasov-Poisson-Amp√®re System, Physics of Plasmas, 27, 022301, DOI: 10.1063/1.5126705, [arxiv: 1909.02149] (2020). The output file bgkhc2d.od8.txt is for results presentation in Fig.1 to 4, and the file bgkhc2d.onm1.txt is for Fig. 5 to 9. Input parameters are listed in the beginning of each output file. Figures are also shown in the files bgkhc2dd8c-fig1-4.pdf and bgkhc2dnm1-fig6-9.pdf, which are generated based on these two output files using the IDL script bgkhc2d.idl.
